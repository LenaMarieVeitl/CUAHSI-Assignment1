# CUAHSI-Assignment1
Open and reproducible research computing

My name is Lena-Marie Veitl. 
I am in my fist year of my master program at the University of Zurich, Switzerland.
I will graduate with a master's degree in Geography with the focus on Human Geography in January 2024.
Besides studying I am working at three jobs.
My fist two jobs are being a lecture assistant for the module “Statistics for Geographers” 
and being a communication manager for the Food Hub at the University of Zurich.
The third job is being an assistant for the chief executive of the booster club of music at Fraumunster, Zurich.
My goal is to work at a National park or a Nature region.

My goals for this module are:
1. To learn how to make computing reproducible for everybody who is interested in
2. To get to know Git and Jupyter
3. To collect more experience in coding.
